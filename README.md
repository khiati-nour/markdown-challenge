## a funny story

 My mother dragged me to the hairdresser to get my long hair cut. Arriving at the hairdresser, i asked to use the bathroom.i opened the window and i runned away to home and my mother and the hairdresser waited. And they waited. Finally, my mother stormed into the bathroom, to discover the window open and i'm not there.
